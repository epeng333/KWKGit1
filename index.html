        <div>
        <p>Hello, I'm Elizabeth. 
            I'm from Los Angeles County, California. 
            I majored in International Studies with a focus in Linguistics at UC San Diego, and I am looking forward to my next adventure in graduate school this fall.</p>

        <p>I was a Kode With Klossy web development scholar in summer 2020.
            I have always thought it would be nice to continue coding in some way, and so I am happy to take part in the KWK x BWDC Data Storytelling Challenge in summer 2025.</p>
